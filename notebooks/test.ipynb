      "Machine learning is a versatile tool used in various industries such as retail, finance, manufacturing, medicine, telecommunications, and science. In finance, banks utilize machine learning for credit applications, fraud detection, and stock market analysis. In manufacturing, learning models are applied for optimization, control, and troubleshooting. In medicine, machine learning aids in medical diagnosis. Telecommunications companies analyze call patterns for network optimization and service quality improvement. In science, computers are essential for analyzing vast amounts of data in physics, astronomy, and biology. The World Wide Web's continuous growth necessitates automated information retrieval. Machine learning is not solely a database issue but also a component of artificial intelligence, enabling systems to learn and adapt to changing environments. It plays a crucial role in pattern recognition, vision, speech recognition, and robotics. Machine learning involves programming computers to optimize performance criteria using example data or past experiences. Statistical theory underpins the construction of mathematical models, with the core task being inference from samples. The training process requires efficient algorithms, and the application of machine learning to large databases is known as data mining. The methods discussed in subsequent chapters have diverse origins, with learning often referred to as estimation in statistics.\n"
